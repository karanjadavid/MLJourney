This repo contains my **Machine Learning** 💻 Journey.🚶🏽‍♂️
Each notebook contains a specific Machine learning model with a clear explanation of how it works. 

- 1. **K Nearest Neighbors** _KNN_
     A classification Supervised Machine Learning
     
- 2. **Linear Regression**
     Introductory theory of lines of best fit
     - R squared, Root Mean Square Error
     - Cross Validation
     - Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
    
- 3. **Model Fine Tuning**
     - Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
     - Logistic Regression, ROC Curve
     - Hyperparameter tuning : (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)

- 4. **Data Preprocessing**
     - Handling Missing Data
     - Imputation, data pipelines
     - Centering and scaling
